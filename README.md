NAND2TETRIS Projects Repository Written by Noam Hasson.
This repository contains my implementation of projects from the "From NAND to Tetris" course, which builds a modern computer system from first principles. Through these projects, I construct a complete hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy upon which a simple but powerful computer system can be built. Course Overview The NAND2TETRIS course is divided into two main parts:

Part I (Hardware, Projects 1-6): Building the hardware platform Part II (Software, Projects 7-12): Building the software hierarchy

Projects Description Hardware Projects (1-6)

Boolean Logic: Implementation of basic logic gates using NAND gates Boolean Arithmetic: ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and adder implementations Sequential Logic: Registers and memory using D Flip-Flops Machine Language: Low-level programming in the Hack assembly language Computer Architecture: CPU and computer implementation Assembler: Program that translates assembly into binary code

Software Projects (7,9,10,11)

VM I: Implementation of stack arithmetic and memory access commands VM II: Implementation of branching and function calling commands High-Level Language: Programming a simple interactive application in Jack Compiler I: Syntax analyzer for the Jack language Compiler II: Code generator for the Jack language

Tools and Testing Each project includes:

HDL files (Hardware Description Language) for hardware projects Assembly/VM/Jack source files for software projects Test scripts provided by the course Additional testing files I've created

Running the Projects

Use the online IDE from NAND2TETRIS official website

1. For projects 1,2,3,5: upload relevant project to the Hardware Simulator and run it

2. For project 4 upload the relevant Aseembly code to the CPU Emulator, translate it to binary code and run it.

3. For project 6 use .asm files to test and run HackAssembler in your command line. Load output to the online CPU Emulator and test results.

4. For projects 7 use .vm files to test and run VMTranslator in your command line. Load output to the online CPU Emulator and test results.

5. For project 9 use the Space Invaders directory to the online compiler, compile it and enjoy playing!

6. For projects 10 use .jack files to test and run JackAnalyzer in you command line. Compare the .xml output file with the given test files.

7. For projects 11 use .jack files to test and run JackCompiler in you command line. Load the output .vm file/s to the VMEmulator and see that the program is behaving as expected.
